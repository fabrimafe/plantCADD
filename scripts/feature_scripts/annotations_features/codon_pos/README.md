generate_codon_positions.sh has all the information to run this.
The outline is running Fabrizio's codon pos python script which gets all positions for any specific codon (1,2,3)
Then basically parsing the output to bed format

example
bash generate_codon_positions.sh /home/labs/alevy/omerbar/features/expanded_SL5/gff_features/SL5.gff3
